  "message": "Operation completed",
  "data": {
    // Response data here
  }
}
```

### Running the Automation Runner

#### One-Shot Execution
```bash
python backend/automation_runner.py
```

#### Continuous Execution

await runner.run_continuous(check_interval_minutes=30)
```

### Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:
```env
# Automation Settings
AUTOMATION_ENABLED=True
CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES=30

# Budget Optimization
DEFAULT_MARKETING_BUDGET=10000

# Churn Prediction
CHURN_THRESHOLD=0.7
MIN_ENGAGEMENT_DAYS=14

# Task Scheduler
NUM_WORKERS=4
MIN_SAMPLE_SIZE_AB_TEST=1000

# Key Rotation
KEY_ROTATION_CRITICAL_DAYS=30
KEY_ROTATION_HIGH_DAYS=60
KEY_ROTATION_MEDIUM_DAYS=90

# Health Checks
HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL_HOURS=1
HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=5
```

## Best Practices

1. **Budget Optimization**: Run daily to adjust marketing spend based on latest ROI data
2. **Churn Prediction**: Run twice daily to catch at-risk users early
3. **Health Checks**: Run hourly to maintain system reliability
4. **Key Rotation**: Check daily, rotate on schedule or when compromised
5. **A/B Tests**: Require minimum 1000 impressions before drawing conclusions
6. **Enterprise Onboarding**: Automate standard steps, manual for custom requirements
7. **Usage Monitoring**: Track continuously, alert at 80% capacity

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Budget optimizer not allocating correctly
- Check historical data format matches expected schema
- Ensure all channels have data points
- Verify total_budget is positive number

**Issue**: Churn predictor not triggering campaigns
- Verify users have churn risk level >= medium
- Check email/notification services are configured
- Review campaign action templates

**Issue**: Task scheduler bottlenecks
- Increase number of workers
- Review task dependencies for circular refs
- Check task duration estimates are accurate

**Issue**: Health checks timing out
- Increase timeout values
- Check network connectivity to services
- Verify service endpoints are correct
